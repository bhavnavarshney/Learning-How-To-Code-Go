/*
Hands-on exercise #5
Building on the code from the previous example
at the package level scope, using the “var” keyword, create a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER “y”. The variable should be of the UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom TYPE “x”
eg:
	
in func main
this should already be done
print out the value of the variable “x”
print out the type of the variable “x”
assign your own VALUE to the VARIABLE “x” using the “=” OPERATOR
print out the value of the variable “x”
now do this
now use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in “x” to the UNDERLYING TYPE
then use the “=” operator to ASSIGN that value to “y”
print out the value stored in “y”
print out the type of “y”

type sample int
var x sample
var y int

func main(){
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n",x)
	x = 42
	fmt.Println(x)

	y=int(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	fmt.Printf("%T",y)
}
